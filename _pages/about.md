I am a master's student at the School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, advised by Professor Wang Yijie. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Central South University in 2025.

My research interests include cloud storage, distributed computing technology, and artificial intelligence.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
